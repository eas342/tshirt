procFiles: example_data/jwst_stripe_mode_imaging/*.fits ## files on which to do Phot
excludeList: null
srcName: Weak Lens Row-Sub
srcNameShort: rowSub
nightName: JWSTWLP8forRowColTest
refStarPos: ## positions of the stars in [x,y]. The first one is the target
   - [995, 57]
refPhotCentering: null ## photometry fits file where to obtain centroid shifts to apply from 1 star/source
copyCentroidFile: null ## photometry or centroid fits file where to obtain centroids to avoid re-calculating
srcGeometry: Circular ## Source aperture geometry, Circular or Rectangular
bkgSub: True ## Do background subtraction?
bkgGeometry: CircularAnnulus ## Background geometry, Circular Annulus or Rectangular
bkgMethod: rowAmp ## Method for background estimate (mean, median, robust mean)
apRadius: 62. ## Source aperture radius
#apHeight: 40 ## Source aperture height (only for rectangular aperture)
#apWidth: 1502 ## Source aperture width (only for rectangular aperture)
#nanTreatment: 'zero' ## How to treat NaNs in image? 'zero' will set to 0. 'value' will set to nanReplaceValue
backStart: 110. ## Background annulus start radius
backEnd: 111. ## Background annulus end radius
backOffset: [0.,0.] ## Background offset (from source centroid)
boxFindSize: 6 ## the half-width of the box used for source centroiding
scaleAperture: False ## Scale the aperture with the FWHM?
isCube: False ## Is the data a cube (3D)?
cubePlane: 0 ## The plane to choose if data is in cubes
doCentering: False ## Center the aperturess with Gaussian?
FITSextension: 0 ## FITS extension of science frames
HEADextension: 0 ## FITS extension of the header info (for exposure and timing)
isSlope: True ## Is the FITS image a slope image that should be multiplied by the int time?
subpixelMethod: exact ## Method for subpixel positions in aperture photometry. "exact" will calculate exactly while "center" will use whole pixels (faster to run)
readNoise: 13. ## Read noise in electrons
detectorGain: 2.1 ## Optionally specify the detector gain e-/DN
dateFormat: One Part ## Format of date. "Two Part" is split over DATE-OBS and TIME-OBS, whereas "One Part" is all in DATE-OBS
saturationVal: null ## put in a value so that if the source aperture has more than satNPix points, it's counted as NaN. If None, ignored.
satNPix: 5 ## number of pixels above saturation to declare as Nan
readFromTshirtExamples: True ## read the data from T-shirt examples within the package? Use only for examples.
driftFile: null ## drift file
